# OrderingTheBurger
This is my first project in java language in which I have created a BURGER ORDERING SYSTEM.
Using this project user can enter name of BURGER, name of DRINK, name of SIDE ITEM and TOPPINGS.
After this user will get a order summary(bill) based on the choices he/she has made.
User can press OK to PLACE the order or can press NO to ABORT the order.
